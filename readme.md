Workday Alternative - HR & Payroll Management System

Abstract

This system serves as a comprehensive alternative to Workday, designed to optimize human resource and payroll management processes with an emphasis on automation, security, and scalability. It provides a robust API architecture for personnel administration, payroll computation, authentication protocols, and auditable logging mechanisms. The backend is engineered using FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and JWT authentication, ensuring high efficiency and security.

Key Features

Secure Authentication: Implements JSON Web Token (JWT)-based authentication for secure access control.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Enforces administrative privileges and operational constraints.

Dynamic Employee Management: Supports CRUD operations for personnel records.

Automated Payroll Processing: Computes salaries, deducts applicable taxes, and logs transactions.

Comprehensive Audit Logging: Tracks and archives significant payroll-related activities for compliance.

Automated Email Notifications: Dispatches payroll confirmation emails to employees.

Technological Framework

Backend: FastAPI (Python) for high-performance RESTful API services.

Database Layer: SQLite (development) and PostgreSQL (production) for structured data storage.

Security Model: OAuth2-based authentication with encrypted password storage.

Event-Driven Notifications: SMTP integration for real-time payroll updates.
